# Paddle Stack Queue — GitHub Pages (Fixed JS)

Upload these files (unzip first) to a **public** repo and enable Pages (branch: main, folder: /).
- **Note** the `<script src="app.js?v=fix1"></script>` which busts cache after updates.
- The green "✅ App script loaded" chip appears only if `app.js` ran—handy for debugging.
